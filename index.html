<h1>Federal Indian Day School settlement claims process now open</h1> 
<h2>Approved settlement to provide compensation, fund for healing and commemoration</h2> 

<p>January 13, 2020 – Ottawa, ON — Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada</p> 

<p>Today marks a significant and meaningful occasion as the Federal Indian Day Schools settlement takes effect. This means that thousands of Indigenous people who suffered harm because they attended federally-run Indian Day Schools can now apply for long-awaited compensation. Work will also begin to bring about healing, education and commemoration.<br /><br />This settlement demonstrates the priorities of survivors can be achieved through negotiation instead of litigation. It combines individual compensation with investments to support former students in their ongoing journeys toward healing. This settlement is based on the premise that those who were sent to Federal Indian Day Schools were harmed. All eligible class members will receive a minimum of $10,000 in individual compensation for the harm suffered by attending the schools.  Additional compensation is available for those who experienced more severe cases of abuse.</p> 

<p>The settlement also provides $200 million for community-based Legacy Projects to support commemoration projects, health and wellness programs, "truth-telling" events and the restoration and preservation of Indigenous languages and culture. This funding will be administered by the McLean Day School Settlement Corporation, an independent, not-for-profit corporation.<br /><br /> 
Grants will be made available to organizations to carry out projects within communities. The Corporation is in the process of developing the guidelines and procedures for organizations to follow in applying for grants and these will be made available in the coming weeks.</p> 

<p>The Federal Indian Day Schools settlement represents a historic step forward in Canada's efforts to address the harm caused by federally-run Indian Day Schools. Canada will continue to work with survivors and Indigenous partners to advance reconciliation, promote Indigenous languages and culture, and support the healing and commemoration of those affected by the harmful policies of the past.</p> 

<h2>Quotes</h2> 

<blockquote> 
<p><em>"Today, we honour the legacy of Garry McLean and the work he did with other courageous survivors to right historical wrongs. Thousands of Indigenous people who were harmed by attending federally-operated Indian Day Schools are now able to seek compensation. This is an important step towards healing and justice for day school survivors and their families. This agreement demonstrates a comprehensive approach accomplished by working with survivors which cannot be achieved through court processes. Working with their representatives, we are have made sure that as well as compensation, the Government of Canada is making important investments to ensure access to support for healing, commemoration and culture for the survivors. "</em><br><br> 
The Honourable Carolyn Bennett, M.D., P.C., M.P.<br>Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations<br></p> 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote> 
<p>"This compensation is an important next step in the process of healing and revitalizing our languages, cultures and traditions. Not only does this Settlement recognize the harm Indian Day Schools did to our languages and culture, it also validates the significance of First Nation languages and cultures for our people. First Nation people hold to the belief that our languages and cultures are our inherent gifts given to us by our Creator, and we must ensure our languages and cultures will forever be here for our children, grandchildren and our future as the Original and First people of this country."<br><br> 
Claudette Commanda<br>Representative Plaintiff</p> 
</blockquote> 

<blockquote> 
<p>"With this next step in the Settlement process, it is time for us to focus on our healing and look forward to the health and wellness and language and culture initiatives that will ensure what we and our families endured will never be forgotten."</p> 

<p>Roger Augustine<br>Representative Plaintiff</p> 
</blockquote> 

<h2>Quick facts</h2> 

<ul> 
<li><p>Beginning in the 1920s, close to 200,000 Indigenous children attended federally-operated Indian Day Schools across Canada. Many students who attended these schools experienced trauma, and in some cases, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of individuals entrusted with their care.</p></li> 

<li>The Federal Indian Day Schools settlement will provide $10,000 in individual compensation for thousands of Indigenous people who suffered harm by attending federally operated Indian Day Schools. Additional compensation will be provided for further incidents of physical and sexual abuse, with amounts ranging from $50,000 to $200,000, based on the severity of the abuses suffered.</li> 

<li>The settlement also provides an investment of $200 million in the McLean Day School Settlement Corporation for legacy projects that support healing, wellness, education, language, culture and commemoration for class members and their communities.</li>

About the program 

This program provides funding for non-medical, social support services to seniors, adults with chronic illness, and children and adults with disabilities (mental and physical) on reserve to help them maintain their independence. 

There are three major components: 

    in-home care 

    adult foster care 

    institutional care (for those needing personal non-medical 24-hour care) 
     

Who can apply? 

First Nations, provinces and Yukon receive funding on an annual basis as part of agreements negotiated between the federal, provincial and Yukon governments. 

First Nations, provinces and Yukon then provide assisted living services to eligible recipients. Individuals who believe they may be eligible to receive these services should contact their band's assisted living coordinator or their band manager to arrange an assessment by a health care provider. 
 

Who can receive assisted living services? 

Any individual residing on-reserve, or ordinarily resident on-reserve, who has been formally assessed by a health care provider (in the provinces or Yukon) as requiring social support services. 

Individuals must not have the means to obtain such services themselves, or access to other sources of support from the federal, provincial or Yukon governments. 

Residents of the Northwest Territories or Nunavut are covered by their territorial government program. 
 

Who qualifies as ordinarily resident on-reserve? 

Ordinarily resident on-reserve means that individuals live on-reserve and do not maintain a primary residence off-reserve. 

Individuals who are off-reserve to obtain care not available on-reserve are considered ordinarily resident on-reserve, and eligible for funding through the Assisted Living Program, if all eligibility criteria are met. 

Deadline 

Annual deadlines vary, depending on the signing of the annual agreements. If you are a First Nation, contact your regional office for more details. 
 

How to apply? 

If you are a service-provider: 

The department provides funds annually to First Nations through their core funding agreements. 

Ontario and Yukon receive funding on an annual basis as part of intergovernmental agreements. 
 

If you are an individual looking for services: 

If you are ordinarily resident on-reserve and wish to find out if you are eligible to receive assisted-living services such as in-home care, adult foster care and institutional care under the Assisted Living Program, contact your band's assisted living coordinator or your band's manager.

Question 4. Questions about web Accessibility 

Criterion Assessed: 	 
Knowledge of Web Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.0/2.1 

 

    Which is the correct alt tag for this image?  
    Why? 
     
     

    <img src='ks-bnr-eng.jpg" alt="2 cartoon kids reading books as they site on the floor”> 

    <img src='ks-bnr-eng.jpg" alt="Kids’ Stop”> 
     
     
     

A is correct because it provides a clear description of the photos content that will assist the visually impaired. 

 

 
 

    What attribute must be used to indicate a change in natural language of the page. 
    i.e. if an English page contains a French phase such as: 
    I would recommend reading the book "Venez visiter la ville de Quebec!" before your trip. 
     
     
    <a href="…" lang="fr" hreflang="fr"> "Venez visiter la ville de Quebec!" </a> 
     
     
     
     
     
     

    What is wrong with this phrase: 
    The section highlighted in red, are projects on hold. The section in blue means water related products. The green text means the project is on-going. 

    I would use a semicolon to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought. 

    Or I would create a list with key value pairs  red: projects on hold, blue: water related products, green: project ongoing  

 
 
 
 

    What would be an acceptable “alternative text version” or “long description” for this chart? 
     
     
    alt=”monthly expenses pie chart with 7 sections: 1. rent: 40%, 2. food: 15%, 3. utilities: 7%, 4. car: 9% 5. phone: 8%, 6. miscellaneous: 15%, 7. savings: 6%”

    no they are not descriptive to people using screen readers 

Instead of “click here” or “https.....” I would title the content in the anchors href, so the title of the clickable link is underlined in blue and add an aria label and a blank target to open on a new page. 

 

 
 
 
 

    What is wrong with these links appearing on a web page and within the same section? 

The following documents are available: 

    Report spring flowers (PDF format) 

    Guitars and cars 2019 (PDF format) 

    2019 – 2020 music guide (PDF format) 

The sections class will be readable by the screen reader as a clickable link but each link needs its own
